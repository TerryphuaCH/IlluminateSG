##illuminate SG

illuminate SG is a amified website which anybody can access and use freely. We aim to improve tourism in Singpapore by allowing anyone, Singaporean or not, to rediscover the city they may think they already know inside out. We have 2 firm beliefs which bring illuminate SG to life - that EVERYONE can help tourism in Singapore and that tourism is merely getting to know the city better, from the smallest of shops to the biggest of attractions.

## Design Process
 
Our design process is for everyone who wants to know more about Singapore - whether they already know about Singapore or have never heard of it. Our aim is to facilitate for them by sharing with them what it's like to be a Singaporean living in Singapore and where the hidden gems or tourism hotspots are in Singapore. Additionally, earn points and even rewards for going to visit these places.
As a foreigner, I want to know where I should visit in Singapore and can find recommendations by Singaporeans on illuminate SG

As a Singaporean, I want to know where the hidden gems are  instead of the well-known, crowded and even overpopulated places. I can find these places by recommendations by Singaporeans on illuminate SG.

As a user, I want to gain points and earn a specific reward that illuminate SG offers. I can go to the places that are recommended or spin the daily wheel and play mini games to accumulate illumination (points) to redeem that reward.

WEB WIREFRAME -


This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features
### Existing Features
- Daily Spin the Wheel
Users that log in everyday will have a chance to spin the wheel to gain some points.

- Mini Games (Guess Where)
Users can play mini games to earn points as an alternative to going out to find places and earning points.

- Today’s Recommendations
Everyday, illuminate SG will have a section in their home page of two places where they can go to and earn more points than usual. For example, on a normal day, Merlion Park would only be worth 120 points. But, if Merlion Park is on ‘Today’s Recommendations’, they will earn 180 points instead - a 150% increase in the amount of points they can earn.

- About Page
For those who have close to no knowledge of Singapore and the rich culture, we have an about page which briefly shares the story of Singapore and what it’s like to live in a bustling city like Singapore. The content is raw and genuine since it is written by Singaporeans. This way, foreigners will have a better understanding of what the country is like.

- Places Page
A page of all illuminate SG’s places so people know where they can go to earn points. These places will be permanently there for people to go to anytime. We can work with cafes to have QR codes and place QR codes to be scanned around the tourist hotspots for users to scan. The points that you earn will be fixed unless it is on ‘Today’s Recommendations’.

### Features Left to Implement
- Social Forum
To have a forum where people can share their own adventures at the different illuminate SG spots! This will attract a different audience to the website and could be another way to earn points for users.

- About Forum
Users themselves write about their own experiences in Singapore. For Singaporeans, they could write about their own perspective of the culture in SIngapore and what it’s like to be living in Singapore. For foreigners, they could write about their time here and what they did, their own recommendations and favorites to other foreigners who are planning to visit. This would be on the about page together with the short description we already have.

- More Mini Games
There are more games that could be implemented such as going to places we show them to earn more points.
